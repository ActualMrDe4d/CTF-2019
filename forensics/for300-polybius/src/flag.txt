What is this cabinet before me ope
A yawning void that once had held a screen?
What secrets lie, fast hid, that I can hope
To pull from elder minds electric dreams?

The chips still whole - the boards that lie within
Give frenzied work to tease their secrets hence -
No men in black will find my hidden den
No force on earth can stop the main events

For ROM have I, teased forth from crumbled corpse,
Of that which many harried haunted dreams -
Before you hangs the next step in the course
That none before have run and escaped clean:

These files before you carry all there was,
Within the cab 'twas marked Polybius.

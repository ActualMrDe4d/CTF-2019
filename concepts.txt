100 - Magic Numbers - You're presented with an x86-64 Linux binary.  The binary will notify the user that
there are 3 magic numbers they must find.  These numbers are static, hardcoded values.  After each number is
entered, the binary will either tell the user that the number is incorrect or prompt for the next number.
Once all 3 numbers are correctly entered, the program will "decrypt" and print out the flag.

100 - Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours! - You're presented with a register/login page. You can register
and login to accounts. Once logged in, there's a button that says "Get Flag". If you click it, you'll get an
error saying you're unauthorized. The solution is to modify the JWT stored in localStorage and modify the
admin claim to be true, and change the signing algorithm to none. Since the server doesn't verify algorithm,
it accepts the none signing algorithm, and accepts that you're an "admin". When you hit "Get Flag" with this
crafted JWT, you get the flag.

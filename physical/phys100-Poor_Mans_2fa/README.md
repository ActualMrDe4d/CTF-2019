# 100 - Poor Man's 2FA

## Description
You're presented with two combo keyboxes tha tare shackled together. One is a 4 dial combo style, the other is a push button lock box. Both are easily decodable with no tools required. All information on how to decode them is easily found on YouTube. Inside each box is half the code, so both boxes must be decoded and opened to successfully get the flag.

## Challenge
Wow, what a clever idea. Why spend money on tokens or require carrying around a phone waiting for a SMS pin when you can just have TWO codes!

Open both locks to get the flag.

Flag: `BSidesPDX{tW0_st3p_auth3ntic4ti0n_1s_no7_2f4}`

## Reset instructions
1. Close both boxes, making sure the shackles are interlocked
2. Scramble the 4 code dials on one box
3. Press the reset switch on the other box
